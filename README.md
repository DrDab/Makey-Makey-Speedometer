# Makey-Makey-Speedometer
A speedometer using two makey makeys as input
# Usage
This program is intended to be used in Middle/High school physics class in order to measure the speed of a moving object on a track using two Makey-makey input devices.
To use, follow the steps:
1. Plug two makey-makeys into the computer, and bind the starting input to [W] and end input to [A].
2. Run the JAR file for the speedometer.
3. Click the text box that says "Distance" at the top.
4. Input the distance between the two makeys on the track, and press the "set" button at the bottom.
5. After that, run the moving object down the track with the set makey-makeys.
6. The speed will be displayed in the middle of the window.
7. You may repeat for more trials. Once finished, you may export the results in CSV form for collection of results using LanSchool. The data file is stored in "C:/LanSchool Files". The CSV file contains 2 columns, one is the trial # and the other is the speed.
